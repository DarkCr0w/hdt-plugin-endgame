## End Game
A plugin to semi-automatically save a screenshot at the end of a game. There is a time delay between Hearthstone Deck Tracker detecting the end of a game and the actual display of the Victor/Defeat screen. This delay can vary depending on the game and game mode. In order to take the screenshot the plugin needs to have a delay configured in the settings menu.

The plugin has two modes:
1. **Simple**: automatically presses the *Print Screen* key to trigger the built-in Hearthstone screenshot mechanism. The accuracy is limited as it is entirely dependent on the delay setting.
- **Advanced**: uses the same delay as Simple mode but takes a series of screenshots and allows you to select the best one. This gives a better chance of getting the shot you want.
